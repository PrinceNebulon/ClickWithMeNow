This demonstration will show the Click With Me Now proof of concept integration for Pure Cloud.

The browser on the left is showing a customer's web chat.
The browser on the right is showing the agent handling the web chat.

The Click With Me Now Chrome Extension allows the agent to select a page to either host a session, where the agent shows a page to the customer, or initiate a viewing session, where the customer shows a page to the agent.

When the agent clicks a link to host, the host URL is popped to a new window on the agent's desktop and the view link is inserted into the chat.

<AGENT HOST>

The view link is added to the chat window for the customer to open.

<CUSTOMER VIEW>

The links for an agent to watch the customer's screen work in the same way, but with the links reversed. The agent will get the view link popped in a new window and the customer will get the host link.

<SHOW IT>

This concludes the demonstration of the Click With Me Now integration for Pure Cloud.
